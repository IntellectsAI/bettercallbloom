My roommate was driving home from her parents house about  when a police officer pulled her over for not having her headlights on while driving. She said that the cop had her get out of the car and sit with him while he ran her information. As if that was not alarming enough, the officer told her to shut the door of his car. They were alone together in the car.\\n\\nShe told me that the entire time she was scared of being raped or sexually assaulted. I asked her if she thought the officer was real, and she said yes because of the lights on his car and the police radio communication. That's all she told me before going to bed a couple of minutes ago. She ended up being let go, no ticket or anything, but she is pretty shaken up. This was her first time ever being pulled over. I have never been pulled over, but I told her that I would have never have gotten out of the car for something like that.\\n\\nThat made me wonder:  did she have to get out of her vehicle? What are your rights in that situation? Although I have been driving for a very long time, I believe that all people get pulled over at some point in their lives, and I want to know my rights.\\nAnswer #1: Was it a freeway or busy highway? Did the officer leave his emergency lights on during the entire incident? \\n\\nThis was probably for her safety. She had no headlights and was on the side of the road at night.</td>\n",

The movie The Crow had to be completed by digitally inserting Brandon Lee into some scenes after his death. Who knows what might happen with Leia in future films now that Carrie Fisher has died.\\n\\nWhen a movie uses a CGI reproduction of an actor, does the studio have to pay the estate? Have there been any cases where the family of the actor tried to sue? Or have there been any cases where the actor is alive but too old to play the part so a reproduction was used? What rights to actors have to their own imagery?\\n\\nI live in Maryland, but I assume this applies globally.\\nTopic:\\nContracts\\nAnswer #1: For the Rogue One example, Peter Cushing's estate explicitly authorized the appearance. But it's an unsettled area of law. Typically a famous person has the right to publicity, and can control their image and products cashing in on their image. But actors also usually assign rights to images of their character as part of their contracts; for things like posters and toys. So Harrison Ford can get paid a royalty when a poster of him saying \"Harrison Ford\" gets sold. But if it's a poster of Han Solo, Disney gets the royalty instead, since it's the character, not the actor. \\n\\nIn this case, they're clearly reprising and cashing in on the character, not the particular actor. That affects things in my mind. If they just wanted to insert Maraloyn Monroe, a previously unaffiliated person  just to cash in on their fame, that would change things in my mind. \\n\\nNow, I think they still need to consult with the estate, and offer payment. But how much control the estate has is also up for debate. Do they get script approval? Do they get to pick the voice actor? How much should they be paid? It's all evolving questions that don't really have an answer yet. \\n\\n</td>\n",

I replied once thinking it was a possible real deal and after a short investigation realized it was BS and never replied again. \\n\\nAfter continuous emails on where to send a check, I replied with the FBI office in my city. 3-weeks later, after the guy said the check would be sent \"tomorrow\" he/she (probably a he), sends me a Fedex receipt showing the check arrived at the FBI office. \\n\\nWhat idiot would send a fake check to an address and not google it first? \\n\\nAnyway, now the guy keeps emailing me asking whats going on and he will \"report me to the authorities\" if I don't get back to him. \\n\\nI was thinking of a quick reply telling him I don't have any fake check, nor do I have a contract for this bogus deal. And then insert all the other email addresses the guy has emailed me with, which a few pop up online as known scammers. \\n\\nOr do I just ignore the guy? \\n\\nOr send an FBI tip that they might have this fake check at their office assuming the check actually went there. \\n\\nIn all likelihood the guy is over seas and the FBI does not care. But if the FedEx is real, someone sent it. Probably from a FedEx office and paid cash. \\n\\nThoughts? \\n\\nIgnore? \\n\\nCall the guy out? \\n\\nReport to FBI? I actually reported the guy the first time to a cybercrimes tip with the FBI, never heard back. \\n\\nA mix of I know its fake and I'll call the FBI? \\n\\nAt least he had to pay for a FedEx... These guys are scum. \\n\\nThanks. \\nAnswer #1: Calling BS on this one. If you're really attorney, you need to grow up and represent your profession better. Answer #2: Dog Law specialist here. \\n\\nApparently “good judgement” isn’t a universal attorney attribute. Answer #3: IANAL.\\n\\nIf everyone ignored and refused to engage scammers like this, their market would dry up and they'd stop.\\n\\nIf everyone went to great lengths to get them busted, another one would pop up in their place.  Busting one does nothing (except for one's ego) to stem the flow of new scammers.\\n\\nSo in my opinion non-engagement and simply reporting them to the proper authorities is the \"best\" course of action (however fruitful or fruitless).

Any advice?\\nQuestion:[Here is a link to the actual wording](http://www.txstate.edu/effective/upps/upps-04-04-42.html) but the part that is particularly problematic is this section here defining Sexual Harrasment as when:\\n\\n&amp;gt; \"c.   such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive employment or academic environment.\"\\n\\nThe school has completely removed any requirement of authority being involved in the exchange, and have left it open to where one student may claim sexual harrasment on any other student, even if they have no classes or contact with each other or anything, simply by claiming that any sexual request made them feel like their academic performance was being impaired. This is exactly how it has played out in multiple instances too already. One student hits on another student, and gets reported and investigated under this rule, and all that is required for them to be found \"guilty\" is for the other student to claim that anything they said or did made them feel that their academic performance had been hampered by it, even if it was nothing more than a one-time flirting incidence that stopped immediately after the first instance. \\n\\nIs this fair/legal/right? If not, how should the wording be to be more just? We're just starting to gather support for changing the wording but it'll help if we have exactly what the wording should be changed to. \\n\\nThank you very much for any assistance you can lend, even if it's just \"no you guys are wrong, this is totally an acceptable claim for sexual harassment.\"\\n\\nEdit: because cuts become evident that I'm arguing with people who don't even know the laws they're talking about:\\n\\n&amp;gt; [What Is Sexual Harassment?\\nSexual harassment is a kind of sex discrimination occurring in the workplace as defined by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Traditionally, sexual harassment could not occur outside of the workplace. However, new laws are finding it in certain relationships of trust, such as one with a doctor, an attorney, a social worker, a real estate agent, a banker, a contractor, an executor, a landlord, a teacher, and so on. ](http://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/rights-of-those-accused-of-sexual-harassment.html)\\n\\nY'all can downvote me all you want, that doesn't make you correct. Half the \"advice\" here doesn't even know what sexual harassment is, and just assumes \"if it's sexual, and it could potentially bother anyone at all, it's sexual harassment\". \\nAnswer #1: I'm not sure that is problematic. In real life, sexual harassment can absolutely be committed by a person with no \"power\" over the other person. \\n\\nBut I do have issues with the whole \"judge and jury and no standards of evidence\" thing.

       "{'text': \"Title: Personal information and walmart\\nQuestion:This is whats going on. I bought a nerf gun for my son at Wal-Mart for Christmas. I found the same nerf gun $40 cheaper, so naturally returned it to Wal-Mart. I got a call yesterday (well voicemail) from a Wal-Mart customer who bought the nerf gun.. it gets weird here.. they said Wal-Mart put my personal information on the box and decided to use it to contact me to see if there is anything wrong with it. I am naturally paranoid with my personal information as is most people. Why would they do this? What should I do? sorry if I am in the wrong sub-reddit.. Thanks in advance \\n\\np.s. I do not frequent Wal-Mart often, it was the only place for this particular nerf gun at the moment \\n\\nI am in the chicago area \\nAnswer #1: Your information is personal in nature, but is by no means private.  Your full name, birth date, home address, and sometimes phone numbers are all generally a matter of public record and readily available to anyone who wants them.\\n\\nIt may be weird, but I don't believe it to be illegal.  You can choose to answer or not answer their questions, and you can tell them to not contact you about the Nerf gun in the future.\",\n",
